    <p>"We thought that serving in the armed forces would be an opportunity for us to prove to the general public that we are loyal Canadians, that in time of need, they would see that we have no hesitation to don the King's uniform and go overseas to fight for our country, fight to preserve democracy."
    <br><br>- <em>Former Force 136 (Special Operations Executive) Sergeant</em>

<br><br>When war was declared in 1939, more than 600 Chinese Canadians volunteered to fight for Canada. While Chinese Canadians served in all theatres of the war and many risked their lives for their county, they did not have the right to vote in Canada. 

<br><br>Many young Chinese Canadians believed that serving in the military demonstrated their loyalty and would convince the government and public that they deserved the right to vote. Chinese Canadians did eventually achieve the right to vote in federal elections, soon after the war, in 1947.
